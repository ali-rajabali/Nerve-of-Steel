# Nerve-of-Steel
"""
This program is for MGTC28.
nerve.py is a simple Python script that executes a party game where players sit in a circle.
1. The program displays "Players stand"

2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.

3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins."  Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.
